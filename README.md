This "project" just contains some examples for importing portfolio data into Wordpress

csvImporter_portfolios.csv is what you'd use to import data using the CSV Import Plugin

The All Import plugin also works, but requires paid premium to import custom fields, and Portfolios are setup in our WP instance to be custom fields on a custom post type
